## Problem statement:
You have been hired to work on a new RPG game project. The core classes for the game have been created but we need to populate the game database with appropriate game data. You have been tasked with creating a prototype windows application for adding game characters the system. The prototype should use a ***List*** collection called ***gameCharacters*** to store game character objects in lieu of a database. Rembemer to __document your code fully.__

<br/><br/>
## Desired functionality
The windows application / form should:
* Enable the user to  user to add  game characters to the collection.
* Showing a list of game characters currently in the collection. 
* Validate all user input.
* Upon loading, populate the List collection gameCharacters with an initial set of game characters (minimum of eight) and display the character information the list box. 
* Enable users to select a character from the list and display their details on the form.
* Enable users to update a character’s attributes and commit those changes to the list.

*Note:*
* The list should not display all of the information associated with each character. Instead it should offer a summary (e.g. character name, character type, experience).
* It is not necessary to add inventory items to characters. 
* All data inputted should be appropriately validated. Where input errors have occurred, feedback should be given to the user.  
* You are free to create completely new game character classes with additional traits if you wish.
* You should carefully consider how the desired functionality can be best supported by the UI controls available within the windows .NET framework. I encourage you to experiment with various UI layouts, controls and visual designs.
